overview:
  - "zcret (pronounced 'secret') is a privacy-first secret manager that eliminates the need for central databases or user accounts. It uses a zero-knowledge architecture where all encryption happens locally on your device."
  - "One of its most innovative features is its sharing mechanism: it uses URL hashes to pass encrypted data between users, ensuring that no data ever touches a temporary server or clipboard history."
  - "Designed as a Progressive Web App (PWA), it works offline and feels like a native app on both mobile and desktop."

objectives:
  - "Create a completely decentralized secret management tool"
  - "Implement zero-knowledge encryption in a browser environment"
  - "Design a frictionless sharing experience without account requirements"
  - "Provide AI-driven security analysis for passwords"

keyFeatures:
  - "Multi-Category Storage: Specialized fields for Logins, Contacts, WiFi, Cards, and Notes."
  - "URL Hash Sharing: Share secrets without a middleman using secure, one-time hashes."
  - "AI Security Analyst: Uses Gemini to analyze password strength and provide feedback."
  - "Zero-Knowledge: All data is encrypted with AES-256 locally; no backend ever sees your keys."
  - "Offline Ready: PWA support ensures your vault is always accessible even without internet."

outcomes:
  - "Launched a secure alternative to cloud-based password managers"
  - "Developed a novel 'serverless' sharing protocol"
  - "Achieved high performance with local-first data architecture"
