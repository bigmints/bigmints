overview:
  - "SonicVision 4K is a high-performance audio visualization engine designed for musicians and visual artists. It bridges the gap between sound and vision by rendering complex mathematical geometries in real-time."
  - "The platform leverages Gemini AI to generate contextual 4K backgrounds that react to the mood and frequency of the uploaded audio."
  - "With a built-in master export system, users can render their sessions directly into high-fidelity MP4 videos, making it a powerful tool for social media content creation and live performances."

objectives:
  - "Deliver a low-latency, high-frame-rate visualizer in the browser"
  - "Integrate AI for dynamic, non-repetitive background generation"
  - "Provide professional-grade export capabilities without a dedicated GPU server"
  - "Create a modular style system with Foreground and Environment modulation"

keyFeatures:
  - "Core Object Geometry: 10+ mathematical styles including Phyllotaxis Spiral, Psy-Mandala, and Sonic Bloom."
  - "Environment Flux: 5+ reactive backgrounds from Hyper Tunnels to Nebula Clouds."
  - "Master Export: Direct-to-MP4 video encoder that works entirely in the browser."
  - "AI Powered: Uses Gemini to synthesize backgrounds that match the audio signature."
  - "HUD System: Customizable text overlays and timer HUDs for professional production."

outcomes:
  - "Successfully deployed a cross-platform visualizer used for music promotions"
  - "Optimized browser-based video encoding for 4K resolutions"
  - "Created a unique design system for high-fidelity audio tools"
