# The Future of Interfaces is No Interface

We have spent the last decade perfecting the graphical user interface (GUI). We made buttons rounder, animations smoother, and layouts more responsive.

But the next paradigm shift isn't about better pixels. It's about **fewer pixels**.

## The Rise of Intent-Based Computing

With the advent of advanced LLMs, we are moving from *command-based* interaction (click this button to do X) to *intent-based* interaction (tell the computer what you want, and it figures out the buttons).

### Case Study: Booking a Flight

**Old Way:**
1. Open App
2. Select Dates
3. Select Destination
4. Filter by Price
5. Scroll
6. Book

**New Way:**
"Book me a flight to London next Friday morning, under $600."

## What this means for UX Designers

We need to stop designing screens and start designing **system behaviors**.

- **Trust:** How do we prove to the user the AI did the right thing?
- **Correction:** How easy is it to undo an action taken by an agent?
- **Transparency:** When is the system guessing vs knowing?

The future is exciting, but it requires a fundamental shift in how we think about "users" and "tools".
