# Are the current AI tools built for everyone?

### What’s Missing Without True Democratization of AI?

The more I watch AI get built and hyped, the more I notice how unfinished this whole “AI for everyone” dream really is.

Few examples from my conversations:

*   **A local café owner** tried to use Make.com to send daily menu updates to her WhatsApp group by connecting a Google Sheet (with the daily menu), OpenAI (for message copy), and WhatsApp (via Twilio integration). She spent hours dealing with webhook setup, Make’s module errors, and authentication steps—never getting a reliable result.
*   **An art teacher** attempted to use Zapier and ChatGPT to create individualized art project prompts for her students by linking Google Forms submissions to OpenAI for prompt generation, then emailing the results automatically. She got stuck at Zapier’s “action event” configuration, API key validation, and parsing JSON outputs.
*   **A boutique owner** wanted to use n8n to automatically generate and post personalized Instagram captions for her new arrivals by pulling product info from Shopify, processing it through GPT-4, and posting directly to Instagram. She hit a wall when asked to set up OAuth for Instagram, troubleshoot node failures, and handle JSON data mapping.

### What I have experienced:

*   **Most AI platforms aren’t actually built for regular people.** Take workflow tools like n8n or Make—they’re powerful if you think in nodes and logic, but if you’re not an engineer, they’re just intimidating. Even the so-called “no-code” solutions seem to quietly assume you’re at least a little bit technical.
*   **In conversations with friends**—especially teachers, business owners, and those outside tech—everybody seems to hit the same wall. Everyone can use ChatGPT or Gemini to write an email or summarize a paper, but when it comes time to actually solve your unique problem, or set up your workflow, suddenly it’s like you need a secret degree. And it’s not for lack of trying—curiosity is there, but as soon as you try to go deeper, frustration follows fast.
*   **That’s the real shame:** we’re leaving valuable, practical expertise on the table because the “gate” into AI is too narrow. If only the technical are building, they build for themselves. The people who best understand problems in their own lives and communities end up with no voice in the solutions.
*   **Trust and confusion:** AI feels like a black box to most. The conversation about making AI fair and ethical often doesn’t even reach the people who could actually benefit or bring necessary skepticism.

If AI were truly accessible—simple to set up, easy to learn, forgiving to experiment with—I honestly believe the impact would be everywhere and far more positive.
